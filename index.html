  <h3>Exercise 3</h3>
  <article class=difference>
    <h3>Difference between HTML & HTML5?</h3>
    <p>HTML5 is more user friendly than HMTL because of it's ability to store data locally with user's browser, which also eliminates <br>
      needs of HTTP cookies. The result is that content can be delivered much faster and safer than before. HMTL aso ensures consistency <br>
       across all browsers. Biggest difference between these two is the integration of video and audio into the language's specifications.</p>
