  <h4>Exercise 3</h4>
  <article class=difference>
    <h3>How to enable latin characters example ä, ö etc. in your HTML document?</h3>
    <p>UTF-8 enables usage of almost every known characters, punctations and symbols in the world. HTML5 uses UTF-8 as a default option. <br>
    There is also UTF-16 which knows rest of the character that UTF-8 doesn't but it is recommend to use UTF-8 if your data is mostly <br>
   in western languages, because UTF-16 takes memory two times more than UTF-8.</p>
    <h3>Difference between HTML & HTML5?</h3>
    <p>HTML5 is more user friendly than HMTL because of it's ability to store data locally with user's browser, which also eliminates <br>
    needs of HTTP cookies. The result is that content can be delivered much faster and safer than before. HMTL also ensures consistency <br>
    across all browsers. Biggest difference between these two is the integration of video and audio into the language's specifications.</p>
